    "text": "The Value-Added Tax (VAT) is a significant source of revenue for the Philippine government. In 2024, VAT contributed almost one-third of the country’s total tax collection.\nAn existing proposal in Congress aims to reduce the VAT rate from 12% to 10%. This proposal has sparked debates regarding its potential impact on different socioeconomic groups.\nUnderstanding its incidence is crucial for policymakers to determine who are currently benefiting from the existing VAT structure. COnsidering the proposed changes, it is essential to evaluate the potential effects on various income groups. This study aims to analyze the incidence of VAT in the Philippines using the 2023 Family Income and Expenditure Survey from the PSA.\nThe analysis aims to answer the following questions: - How do households allocate their budgets across different consumption categories? How much is allocated to savings/investments? (optional) - Which types of goods/services are exempt from VAT according to the Tax Code? - What is the distribution of VAT burden across different income groups considering both 1) household consumption patterns, and 2) exemptions based on law? - What is the impact of reducing the VAT rate on various socioeconomic groups?"
