## Introduction

The Value-Added Tax (VAT) is a significant source of revenue for the Philippine government. In 2024, VAT contributed almost one-third of the country's total tax collection.

An existing proposal in Congress aims to reduce the VAT rate from 12% to 10%. This proposal has sparked debates regarding its potential impact on different socioeconomic groups.

Understanding its incidence is crucial for policymakers to determine who are currently benefiting from the existing VAT structure. COnsidering the proposed changes, it is essential to evaluate the potential effects on various income groups. This study aims to analyze the incidence of VAT in the Philippines using the 2023 Family Income and Expenditure Survey from the PSA.

The analysis aims to answer the following questions: - How do households allocate their budgets across different consumption categories? How much is allocated to savings/investments? (optional) - Which types of goods/services are exempt from VAT according to the Tax Code? - What is the distribution of VAT burden across different income groups considering both 1) household consumption patterns, and 2) exemptions based on law? - What is the impact of reducing the VAT rate on various socioeconomic groups?

## Data and Methodology

The analysis utilizes the 2023 Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). The FIES provides comprehensive data on household income, expenditure patterns, and demographic characteristics. A review of the VAT provisions in the Philippine Tax Code was conducted to identify which goods and services in the FIES are subject to VAT and which are exempt. The exemptions list include basic food items, educational services, healthcare services, public transportation, among others. Table \_ provides a summary matrix of the VAT exemptions as defined in the Tax Code and sample covered expenditure items as found in the FIES.
